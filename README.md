#The marketing space is in constant shift as new technologies and marketing tactics gain popularity. Hence, for faster and better decision making, Data Analytics has garnered signiﬁcant attention.This project aims at improving the business strategies of Retail Markets .i.e small datasets dealing with perishable/non-perishable items. We develop predictive models using mining techniques and packages in R, PYTHON which reports,graphs and analyzes the pulse of our business by taking into consideration the required metrics.The models for quantity prediction and price ﬁxing depending on sales performance metrics of storage,product revenue etc are delivered.

#For the second part of this project, we take on the challenge of eradicating issues of seasonal changes, scale of the problem etc.. by sales forecasting and attempt to correctly forecast sales at Walmart. Given the reputation Walmart has about its competitive pricing structure, the ability to accurately project sales is key in its ability to function.This has been addressed by leveraging sales data from 45 Walmart stores across diﬀerent regions. With this data I was able to make predictions on department-wide sales at each of the 45 stores.In addition to this,it has been attempted to understand the impact of mark downs(price reductions)on holiday weeks.However, it is important to note that while we have data for each of the 45 stores regarding department-wide sales, we will be modeling the eﬀect of markdowns without possessing complete historical data. Overall, we hope to understand which attributes signiﬁcantly impact sales at the store level via regression, time series analysis, and decision tree models so that we can ascern those characteristics as key drivers for sales, thus allowing us to generate more accurate forecasts.
